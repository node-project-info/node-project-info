# Node Project Info

Unofficial effort to spread/share info about what's going on in the 
[Node.js](https://github.com/nodejs/node) project.

The goal is to promote project news from collaborators through retweets, toots,
and the like on platforms like twitter, mastodon and Linked in.

By default we will trust collaborators to at mention:
* @nodeprojectinfo on twitter
* [node-projectinfo-978ab7266](https://www.linkedin.com/in/node-projectinfo-978ab7266) on Linkedin
* TBD Mastrodon

for relevant project news. Those post will then be promoted and amplified. Any collaborators
who at mention in posts that spam, promote their commercial interest or otherwise don't appropriately
share project news will be dropped from the list of collaborators that will be amplified.
